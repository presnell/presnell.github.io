For example, if you chose A, C, E, and G to win their quarterfinal games, then your possibilities would be AE, AG, CE, and CG. But you have 4 possible choices no matter which of the 16 sets of teams you picked in the first round, so there are \\(16 * 4 = 64\\) possible ways to fill out the first two rounds (quarterfinals and semifinals).\n No matter which teams you picked to win in the quarterfinals and semifinals, you can choose either of your two semifinal winners to win the final game. Thus, no matter which of the 64 possible ways you chose to fill in the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds, you have 2 possible ways to finish your bracket, leaving you with a total of \\(64 * 2 = 128\\) possible ways to fill in the complete bracket.\n Notice that there were 4 games in the first round, 2 games in the second round, and 1 game in the final round, for a total of 7 games, and the number of possible brackets turned out to be \\[ 2^4 \\times 2^2 \\times 2^1 = 2^{(4 + 2 + 1)} = 2^7 = 128. \\]\n  So How Many Possible Brackets for the 64 Team NCAA Tournament?   Now, considering the real March Madness tournament, if we ignore the play-in games, there are 63 games in the tournament: 32 first round games, 16 second round games, 8 \u0026#34;Sweet 16\u0026#34; games, 4 \u0026#34;Elite 8\u0026#34; games, 2 \u0026#34;Final Four\u0026#34; games, and 1 championship game (32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 63). Following the same logic as we did for the eight-team tournament:\n  You could pick either of the two teams in each of the 32 first round games, so altogether there are \\(2^{32} = \\text{4,294,967,296}\\) possible sets of winners you could pick for the first round.\n  Similarly, for whatever set of 32 teams you picked to win the first round games, there are \\(2^{16} = \\text{65,536}\\) different sets of teams that you could to win their 2nd round games, so by the time you fill in your teams for the first 2 rounds, you have chosen 1 of \\(2^{32} * 2^{16} = 2^{48} = \\text{281,474,976,710,656}\\) possibilities.\n  Continuing in this way, we find that there are \\[ 2^{32} * 2^{16} * 2^8 * 2^4 * 2^2 * 2^1 = 2^{63} \\] possible ways to fill in your bracket. That\u0026#39;s \\[ 2^{63} = \\text{9,223,372,036,854,775,808} \\] or roughly 9 quintillion (a quintillion is a billion billions).\n So, if you flipped a coin to pick your team in each of the 63 games, meaning that you picked your bracket completely at random from among the 9 quintillion possibilities, then the probability that you would pick the perfect bracket for that year\u0026#39;s tournament would be 1 in 9 quintillion.\n For comparision, the probability that a randomly chosen Floridian would be killed by lightning in the next year is a little less than 1 in 3 million, so that randomly chosen Floridian has a 3 trillion (3,000,000,000,000) times greater chance of being killed by lightning next year than a randomly chosen bracket has of being perfect.\n However, and I can\u0026#39;t emphasize this enough, this probability of choosing a perfect bracket is only correct if you randomly choose your bracket by flipping a fair coin 63 times. Of course absolutely no one picks their bracket this way.\n  So What\u0026#39;s the Actual Probability of Picking a Perfect Bracket?   If you didn\u0026#39;t have any opinion at all about the relative strengths of the teams, and if you weren\u0026#39;t concerned about competing with other bracket pickers for a prize, then it would be much better to just pick the higher seeded team to win each game, and then pick whichever of the 1 seeds you prefer in the semifinal and final games (there are \\(2^3 = 8\\) ways you could choose the winners of these last 3 games). The probability that the tournament will go completely \u0026#34;by the chalk\u0026#34; and give you a perfect bracket is still vanishingly small, but it\u0026#39;s bigger than 1 in 9 quintillion.\n For example, in 2023, I would have estimated the probability that this \u0026#34;chalk\u0026#34; method would yield a perfect bracket to be somewhere between 1 in 291 billion and 1 in 84 billion, depending on which teams you chose to win the final three games. Those are still extremely small probabilities, and our randomly chosen Floridian is still somewhere between 25,000 and 93,000 times more likely to die from a lightning strike this year, but the chalk method is a lot better than flipping coins.\n  Some Other Comments on Perfect Brackets  Why You Probably Shouldn\u0026#39;t Choose a Completely by the Chalk Bracket for Your Pool   If you are competing in a bracket pool, then your objective is to maximize your expected winnings. This is not the same as choosing your bracket to maximize your chances of being perfect (which is practically impossible anyway), and it\u0026#39;s not even the same as maximizing your expected final \u0026#34;score\u0026#34;. For example, picking the higher seeded team to win every game is generally not a good strategy, because lots of other people will do the same, or close to it, so even if you did win, you would probably split the pot with a lot of other players.\n  How Did I Estimate the Probability that a \u0026#34;By the Chalk\u0026#34; Bracket is Perfect?   If you have a way to estimate the probability that team A wins over team B in any potential matchup in the tournament, then you can estimate the probability that a given bracket turns out to be perfect in a given year. Many of the \u0026#34;power ratings\u0026#34; that are provided by various sites on the web can be used to estimate the needed probabilities, although the sites don\u0026#39;t usually tell you how to do it. For the calculation I did above for the 2023 tournament, I used the team ratings from FiveThirtyEight.com. Unfortunately these won\u0026#39;t be available anymore due to cutbacks at Disney/ABC, so I\u0026#39;ll have to use something else for 2024.\n  What About the Play-in Games?   Note: If you have to pick the 4 play-in games as well, then you have to pick the winners of 68 games, so in this case there are \\[ 2^{67} = \\text{147,573,952,589,676,412,928} \\] possible brackets, and the probability that a bracket chosen by flipping coins turns out perfect is about 1 in 148 billion billion.\n      Analyzing the Importance of 3 Additional Basketball Statistics   You said:\n We’d also give you 3 additional basketball statistics (points per game, assists per game, win/loss ratio, etc.) to analyze their statistical importance (or lack thereof) in determining the winner of a game.\n  I\u0026#39;m not sure that I would have the data at hand, or the spare time, to properly answer this question. Maybe, but given the other things I need to get done in the meantime, it\u0026#39;s very doubtful.\n  What\u0026#39;s My Interest in All of This?   Since at least the early 2000\u0026#39;s I have participated in a small \u0026#34;portfolio pool\u0026#34; with some other statisticians and computer scientists, as well as some \u0026#34;civilians\u0026#34;. I started thinking a little more seriously about it in the 2010\u0026#39;s and around 2016 I got an idea for how I might optimize my picks for the pool. This led to me simulating the March Madness tournament on my home computer and using the outcomes to help me make my selections. My methods have evolved over the years and these days I run hundreds of thousands, and even millions of simulations of the tournment to generate training and test sets for choosing my picks and evaluating how well they are likely to perform. Almost every year I have ideas for improvements that I frantically implement and test out at the last minute so that I can submit my picks before the tournament begins. I have certainly learned a lot in the process.\n I know of at least one other pool participant who is doing similar things: he leads a large-scale optimization research team at Google. A group of us started comparing ideas a couple of years ago and we hope at some point to write a paper (or two) about it.\n  ","date":1708495921,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1708496673,"objectID":"b6f0a038e55d419f29727875a8aca9b3","permalink":"https://presnell.github.io/talk/marchmadness/","publishdate":"2024-02-21T01:12:01-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/marchmadness/","section":"talk","summary":"Probability of a Perfect Bracket  A Primer: The Number of Possible Brackets for an Eight-Team Tournament   I think it\u0026#39;s easiest to understand this by first considering a tournament with only 8 teams (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) and hence three rounds:","tags":[],"title":"Response to James Sullivan, UF Strategic Communications \u0026 Marketing","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The morons betting league (MBL2) is a small informal group of friends (morons) who compete every week by picking ten football bets (NCAAF and NFL) totaling 100 \u0026ldquo;units\u0026rdquo; against the spread and/or over-under Here\u0026rsquo;s a small sample of the data.

In that time I have used at least five different emacs email clients: MH-E, VM, Mew, gnus, and now mu4e. I have also adapted to many different email server setups, and I have helped many of my current and especially my former colleagues do the same.\n Some years ago now our departmental email server was shut down and our email moved to a Microsoft Exchange server. The Exchange IMAP server (used for reading email) in conjunction with gnus was so slow that it was unusable, so I switched to a combination of the mu4e emacs client with a local maildir store kept in sync with the server by offlineimap. I was serving as department chair at the time and the super fast search provided by mu was really nice to have with all the email that comes with that position.\n A few years ago the university decided to completely outsource its email services to Microsoft, so I configured offlineimap to retrieve my email from outlook.office365.com. This posed no problems until recently, when Microsoft deprecated the “Basic Auth” protocol for checking email in favor of “Modern Auth” (oath2) and I was once again forced lose a long weekend adapting to a new email setup.\n I admit that I am trying to do all this while minimizing the number of things that I actually have to understand about how any of these protocols work. I spent way too much of my earlier life setting up departmental email servers and clients before finally swearing off ever doing that again, and I have spent a great deal of time in the intervening years adapting to changing email environments and helping colleagues to do the same. At this point in my life I am completely uninterested in how any of this works beyond what is absolutely required for me to use it — I just want to continue to read and write work email in the same development environment (emacs) that I use for everything else.\n  Slightly More Technical Background   There are two parts to this problem: retrieving and syncing email with Microsoft\u0026#39;s IMAP server, which I have been doing with offlineimap; and sending email messages via Microsoft\u0026#39;s SMTP (Symmetric Mail Transport Protocol) server, which I have been doing for many years with emacs\u0026#39;s built-in sendmail code. There do exist emacs packages named oauth2, auth-source-xoauth2, and oauth2-request, but I didn\u0026#39;t get very far with any of them and they wouldn\u0026#39;t help me on the IMAP side, because I use an external program (offlineimap) for that interaction (and having become used to mu4e I\u0026#39;m not going back to gnus).\n So, I needed (1) to find another way to send email that works with oauth2, and (2) to either configure offlineimap to work with oauth2 or find another program to handle interactions with the IMAP server. For sending email messages, the most commonly used sendmail replacement seems to be msmtp, so I planned to use that, assuming that I could configure it to use oauth2. (If you don\u0026#39;t know, the actual sending of messages is traditionally handled separately from reading and managing messages and folders.)\n BTW, to retrieve/sync and send email via Microsofts servers with oauth2, one must have a registered \u0026#34;client app\u0026#34;. There is a mechanism for registering such an app with Microsoft Azure (whatever that is), but this failed for me because my institution does not allow me (or anyone?) to register a new app. This means that I must do what everyone else apparently does, which is to use the client ID and secret for Mozilla\u0026#39;s Thunderbird email client (there\u0026#39;s actually nothing secret about these and you will see them below).\n Early on in my search for a solution, I tried M365-IMAP (python) to handle the authentication. I was able to make it work with offlineimap, but the authorization token or tokens have to be updated periodically (every hour or so?). I also don\u0026#39;t want to be storing them in a clear text file, so the barebones usage outlined there won\u0026#39;t work for me. Still, at a minimum, this is a good way to retrieve some actual authentication tokens to experiment with.\n I also tried mailctl and I got it to work with msmtp but not with offlineimap. I tried another method, but the initial authentication step (which uses a browser) wouldn\u0026#39;t work for me because all the graphics (buttons) for my institutions login page didn\u0026#39;t show up, leaving me unable to complete the 2-factor authentication. (I think I was trying either email-oauth2-proxy or oauth-helper-office-365 when I ran into this problem.)\n I finally came across Larie Tratt\u0026#39;s pizauth and this actually seems to work for me and takes care of any worries about storing any authentication details on disk. However, I didn\u0026#39;t manage to get it working with offlineimap (I\u0026#39;m sure that\u0026#39;s on me), so I decided to switch over to isync/mbsync, which I was already aware of as a faster alternative to offlineimap. The rest of this describes the process of getting this working on Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS), a.k.a., \u0026#34;Ubuntu Jammy\u0026#34;.\n  Setting Up pizauth   First we need a Rust compiler. For this, just go to the Getting Started page for rust and follow the instructions to use the Rustup tool to install Rust. This will install a personal copy of rust in your home directory (as opposed to a system-wide installation). Then add the following lines to your ~/.profile (or wherever you keep your shell startup stuff):\nsource ~/.cargo/env   You may need to reload your .profile (or your .bashrc) or just log out and log back in again to get the rust compiler on your path.\n Next download pizauth either from Laurie Tratt\u0026#39;s web pages or from the Github repository and untar/unzip it if necessary. I was able to compile the program with make but sudo make install failed because sudo doesn\u0026#39;t have the Rust compiler on it\u0026#39;s path. To fix this, I edited the Makefile and changed these lines\ninstall: cargo build --release install -d ${PREFIX}/bin ...  to\ninstall: # cargo build --release install -d ${PREFIX}/bin ...  This works becuase the cargo build --release step is already done when you run make (without sudo) to compile the program, so it can safely be left out of the installation step. (For reference, cargo is the Rust package manager.)\n So again, after this edit, just run the following commands to compile pizauth and install it in /usr/local.\ncd pizauth-0.1.0 make sudo make install   I next created the file ~/.config/pizauth.conf, whose contents are given below. The client_id and client_secret are actually for thunderbird, but this works. For your own use you may want to change \u0026#34;UF\u0026#34; to something else (e.g., \u0026#34;work\u0026#34;) and you will have to replace my email address with your own on the login_hint line.\naccount \u0026#34;UF\u0026#34; { auth_uri = \u0026#34;https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize\u0026#34;; token_uri = \u0026#34;https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token\u0026#34;; client_id = \u0026#34;08162f7c-0fd2-4200-a84a-f25a4db0b584\u0026#34;; client_secret = \u0026#34;TxRBilcHdC6WGBee]fs?QR:SJ8nI[g82\u0026#34;; scopes = [ \u0026#34;https://outlook.office365.com/IMAP.AccessAsUser.All\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://outlook.office365.com/SMTP.Send\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;offline_access\u0026#34; ]; // You don\u0026#39;t have to specify login_hint, but it does make // authentication a little easier. login_hint = \u0026#34;presnell@ufl.edu\u0026#34;; }   Next run\npizauth server  You shouldn\u0026#39;t see any output from this. Assuming that all has gone well to here, run (again, change UF to whatever you used for the account name in your pizauth.conf file.\npizauth show UF  The first time you do this a URL will be output. Copy this URL and open it in your browser and do whatever is needed to authenticate with your institution (if your browser is already authenticated, you may not have to do anything but open the URL). To see if this worked, run pizauth show UF again and you should see the access token obtained.\n  Installing and Configuring msmtp   This one is easy to install:\nsudo apt install msmtp   Next create the file ~/.msmtprc with the following contents, which again will need to be modified to match your situation.\n## UF email via office365 (Microsoft) account UF auth xoauth2 host smtp.office365.com protocol smtp port 587 tls on tls_starttls on from presnell@ufl.edu user presnell@ufl.edu passwordeval pizauth show UF   At this stage you can test that sending email is working by running something like:\nprintf \u0026#34;Subject: Test\\n\\nHello there me.\u0026#34; | msmtp -a UF your_personal_account@gmail.com  and checking that the mail is received at your personal account.\n An error similar to this:\nsh: 1: pizauth: Permission denied msmtp: cannot read output of \u0026#39;pizauth show UF\u0026#39;  probably indicates that your OS (Ubuntu for me) has put some overly restrictive apparmor conditions on msmtp. You can fix this by disabling apparmor for msmtp like this:\nsudo ln -s /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp /etc/apparmor.d/disable/ sudo apparmor_parser -R /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.msmtp    Installing and Configuring isync/mbsync   Again, installion of the isync package is routine.\nsudo apt install isync   To use mbsync with oauth2, you also need to install an xoauth2 plugin for SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer). There are several available, and I first tried the ppa on Cononical\u0026#39;s Launchpad, but it did not work for me. The most commonly used plugin seems to be this one (I think that it is used in Arch linux and in Free BSD). To install it, I followed the instructions in the Install Cyrus SASL OAuth2 section of this page. As prerequisites, you need to install that libsasl2-dev package and if you want to do the last step (verifying that XOATH2 is known to SASL probably isn\u0026#39;t necessary), you will also need to install the sasl2-bin package to get the saslpluginviewer command:\nsudo apt install libsasl2-dev sasl2-bin  After this just follow the instructions mentioned above, i.e.,\n# Clone the Cyrus SASL OAuth2 sources. git clone https://github.com/moriyoshi/cyrus-sasl-xoauth2.git # Configure and make. cd cyrus-sasl-xoauth2 ./autogen.sh ./configure # SASL2 libraries on Ubuntu are in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/; modify the Makefile accordingly sed -i \u0026#39;s%pkglibdir = ${CYRUS_SASL_PREFIX}/lib/sasl2%pkglibdir = ${CYRUS_SASL_PREFIX}/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sasl2%\u0026#39; Makefile make sudo make install # Verify XOAUTH2 is known to SASL. saslpluginviewer | grep XOAUTH2   Finally, I created a ~/.mbsyncrc file with the contents below. By default Outlook creates and syncs a bunch of folders that I don\u0026#39;t use. I basically keep everything in INBOX and Archive and use mu to find things quickly, so it\u0026#39;s easiest for me to just list the folders that I want in the Patterns line. If you create a lot of folders for your email, then it might be easier to say what you don\u0026#39;t want (there are examples online of how to do this), or just use * and download everything.\n Also, for initial testing, the RECOMMENDATIONS section of the [[https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jammy/man1/mbsync.1.html][mbsync man page]] recommends leaving Expunge None (the default) to make sure you don\u0026#39;t lose mail if anything goes awry.\n Finally, I set Create Near so that folders (mailboxes) would be created on the local side when I initially sync things up, but I don\u0026#39;t really want to create any new folders on either end. You might prefer Create Both, which I assume is a lot more common.\n Note that a \u0026#34;Channel\u0026#34; in mbsync combines a Far with a Near store; in this case the UF channel combines UFRemote and UFLocal.\nIMAPAccount UF Host outlook.office365.com User presnell@ufl.edu Port 993 SSLType IMAPS SSLVersions TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 AuthMechs XOAUTH2 PassCmd \u0026#34;pizauth show UF\u0026#34; IMAPStore UFRemote Account UF MailDirStore UFLocal Path ~/Maildir/UF/ Inbox ~/Maildir/UF/INBOX Subfolders Verbatim Channel UF Far :UFRemote: Near :UFLocal: SyncState * ## I only want these 5 folders: Patterns \u0026#34;INBOX\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Archive\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Drafts\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Sent Items\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Deleted Items\u0026#34; ## You can sync EVERYTHING by using this line instead: ## Patterns * Create Near Expunge Both   I also had to manually create the ~Maildir/UF directory. You probably don\u0026#39;t want that to be readable by anyone but you either, so set the permissions accordingly.\nmkdir -p ~/Maildir/UF chmod -R go-rwx ~/Maildir   Finally, test by running the following command. It will take a while the first time to download all your email.\nmbsync UF  Socket error: unexpected eof   I consistently get the following error message when I run mbsync UF, but the error doesn\u0026#39;t seem to cause any problems.\nSocket error: secure read from outlook.office365.com (52.96.29.82:993): error:0A000126:SSL routines::unexpected eof while reading    Duplicate messages   This post may be useful for diagnosing and fixing duplicate message errors from mbsync.\n    Installing mu and mu4e   I\u0026#39;m going to install the latest version of mu and mu4e from github. If you\u0026#39;re happy with an older version, you can install the Ubuntu package maildir-utils with apt.\n It might be a good idea to clear out any existing mu and mu4e installations if you have used them before, e.g., with sudo apt purge maildir-utils. I had installed them manually from source, so I did something like this:\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/mu sudo rm -r /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e sudo rm -r /usr/local/share/man/man*/mu-* sudo rm /usr/local/share/man1/mu.1 sudo rm /usr/local/share/man1/mug.1 sudo rm -r /usr/local/share/doc/mu   Make sure these prerequisite libraries are installed. Add emacs to the list of packages if you don\u0026#39;t already have it (I use emacs-snapshot from a ppa so I\u0026#39;m not including that here).\nsudo apt install libgmime-3.0-dev libxapian-dev   Next install the meson build system.\nsudo apt install meson ninja-build   Now we can download the most recent release of mu (currently 1.8.10) and install as below. It is possible that there are prerequisite packages that need to be installed with apt, but if so, I seem to have all of them already installed from previous installations of mu.\ncd ~/Download tar -xf mu-1.8.10.tar.xz cd mu-1.8.10 meson build \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ninja -C build sudo ninja -C build install # By default this will install into /usr/local   To index your mail, just run:\nmu init --maildir=~/Maildir --my-address=presnell@ufl.edu --my-address=presnell@stat.ufl.edu mu info # Checking everything is correct mu index    Configuring mu4e   Further Notes    It looks like this person had a similar ordeal\nMy comments for Laurie Tratt\u0026#39;s blog post on pizauth:      Works for me! Thanks so much for this. I lost access to my work email last week when MS turned off basic authentication. After I had struggled to arrive at an acceptable (no tokens stored in unencrypted files) and complete (IMAP and SMTP both working smoothly) solution with any of the other options I came across, pizauth saved the day. I had been using offlineimap + mu + mu4e and emacs\u0026#39;s built-in sendmail stuff. I ended up with pizauth + mbsync + msmtp + mu + mu4e, but it\u0026#39;s working, so I\u0026#39;m happy.\n A few comments:\n  I have rust installed via rustup (so in my home directory) and on my linux box (Ubuntu 22.04) I couldn\u0026#39;t get sudo to use it for \u0026#34;sudo make install\u0026#34;, so I commented the \u0026#34;cargo build –release\u0026#34; step out of the install recipe in the Makefile. With that change \u0026#34;make; sudo make install\u0026#34; worked without a hitch.\n  My institution does not allow me to register a new application with Azure, so I\u0026#39;m just using the client id and secret for thunderbird, which I assume is what most people are doing.\n  Offlineimap will work with OAuth2 (I verified this by generating access and renew tokens and manually entering them into my .offlineimaprc file). I think that it should work with pizauth (by calling pizauth in a manner similar to this (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/OfflineIMAP#Configuring_OAuth2_and_getting_access_tokens_via_mailctl) or this (https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rs46/posts/2022-01-11-mu4e-oauth.html) but somehow I failed to get it to work. FWIW, I thought that offlineimap needed both an access token and a renewal token, and assuming that both would eventually expire if not used, I don\u0026#39;t see how to get the refresh token from pizauth.\n Today I noticed that offlineimap also has built-in functionality for renewing OAuth2 tokens (https://gist.github.com/piyueh/a2d65e095ea675a2c715ad42b7b61d10). I didn\u0026#39;t realize this, so I may have misunderstood some of the configuration advice that I encountered elsewhere. I certainly would have continued with offlineimap if I had managed to get everything working properly, but mbsync does seem to be a bit faster, so there\u0026#39;s that I guess.\n     ","date":1665346618,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1705596929,"objectID":"84a3b6a3106215216f4fd602ef4eafc7","permalink":"https://presnell.github.io/post/email/","publishdate":"2022-10-09T16:16:58-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/email/","section":"post","summary":"Background   I\u0026#39;ve been reading and sending email with GNU Emacs since about 1991.

Years ago, while teaching our undergraduate categorical data analysis course, I created a small R package consisting mainly of datasets from the text An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis (2nd edn) by my colleague Alan Agresti, along with a few convenience functions.

After a very long hiatus from needing to run R in the classrooms, I am back at it. The classroom (Windows 10) PCs at UF are refreshed every night and all local files created by users are wiped. By default, R packages installed by users are placed in C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library,1 and like everything else that users create, they are wiped every night. Thus, if you accept the default behavior, you have to resintall any packages you need every time you need them.2 This has been the source of some frustration for me and at least one of my colleagues, so I decided to do something about it. This post describes my current (partial) solution, which I think should also be useful for folks running R or RStudio on a desktop PC in their office (in my department at UF anyway). It\u0026#39;s nothing fancy, and if someone has a better solution I would be happy to hear about it.\n  My Solution   Download this file and save it under the name .Rprofile in your home directory on the departmental file server (so ~/.Rprofile in linux and H:/.Rprofile in Windows), or use a text editor to create the file yourself with with the following contents:\nif (grepl(\u0026#34;Windows\u0026#34;, Sys.info()[\u0026#34;sysname\u0026#34;])) { my.lib.path \u0026lt;- file.path(\u0026#34;H:\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;R\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;win-library\u0026#34;, paste(R.version$major, sub(\u0026#34;\\\\..*$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, R.version$minor), sep=\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;)) if (!dir.exists(my.lib.path)) dir.create(my.lib.path, recursive = TRUE) .libPaths(my.lib.path) rm(my.lib.path) }   Now, whenever you start R in the classroom, run the command\nsource(\u0026#34;H:/.Rprofile\u0026#34;)   This first checks that you are running R in Windows. If so, then it checks for the existence of the directory H:/R/win-library/X.Y, where X is the major version number and Y is the minor version of the current R process, and it creates this directory if it doesn\u0026#39;t already exist. It then adds this directory to the front of R\u0026#39;s library path so that (1) R will look for packages there before trying the system packages, and (2) R will install any new packages into this directory rather than the system directory.\n If anything about that is not ok with you, then you will need to modify .Rprofile to suit your specific needs. If you already have a directory of installed R packages, you can either move/rename it to match this scheme, or you can modify the script to match, assuming that your directory is on your H: drive.\nIf You Run R in Windows in Your Office   If you place a copy of this .Rprofile file in whatever directory is returned by the R command path.expand(\u0026#39;~\u0026#39;) (probably C:/Users/\u0026lt;yourusername\u0026gt;/Documents), then R will run it automatically upon startup (on your office PC) and any libraries you install in your office will be saved to your H: drive. Also, as long as your office PC and the classroom PCs are running the same version of R, they will share the same set of user-installed R packages.\n    Further Background and Explanation   You can skip this if you like …\n When I login to a classroom machine, my home directory from the departmental (virtual) file server is mounted as the H: drive in Windows. So, to sidestep the problem of repeatedly installing packages, I initially created the folder R/win-library/3.53 in my home directory on the file server, and in the classroom, I just ran the R command .libPaths(\u0026#34;H:/R/win-library/3.5\u0026#34;) immediately after starting R (or RStudio). With this, any libraries I install are saved on the departmental file server and they are found again the next time I teach (once I have run that command).\n Of course this is still pretty annoying and I wanted to arrange things so that it would be done automatically by an .Rprofile startup file. This works if the file is placed in C:/Users/myusername/Documents, which the R command path.expand(\u0026#39;~\u0026#39;) returns as be the default user home on our classroom Windows PCs, but of course that file would also get wiped every night, so placing the file there doesn\u0026#39;t help.\n Nevertheless, to accomodate differing/changing versions of R and to automate the process as much as possible, I decided to create a .Rprofile that checks if I am running Windows and if so, sets my R library path to .libPaths(\u0026#34;H:/R/win-library/X.Y\u0026#34;). The X.Y is replaced by whatever \u0026#34;major.minor\u0026#34; version of R is running (currently 3.5) and the directory is created if it doesn\u0026#39;t already exist. Because this is done only if I am running Windows, it has no effect on my usual, completely satisfactory R environment in Linux.\n The contents of my current .Rprofile file are given in the previous section. If you already have a non-empty .Rprofile, you could add this to it, and of course you could also create different versions for different classes and put them in the appropriate places if that tickles your fancy. In the classroom I still have to run\nsource(\u0026#34;H:/.Rprofile\u0026#34;)  after starting R, but I guess I\u0026#39;m going to have to live with that.\n  Footnotes   1Coming from the UNIX/Linux world this already seems a bit crazy. Why am I running R as root here? BTW, you should mentally replace \u0026#34;3.5.2\u0026#34; with whatever version of R is currently installed on the PC, and Windows/DOS users may be more comfortable replacing the \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; path separator by \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;.\n 2The classroom IT folks suggest using a USB thumbdrive as a workaround. insert sad face here\n 3From what I saw on the classroom PCs, it appears that win-library is the R default name for the user\u0026#39;s R libraries in Windows, so I decided to stick with that. (On Linux it\u0026#39;s something like x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library.)\n    ","date":1596898140,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596898140,"objectID":"e67b226da41d629aa34e9276488ec470","permalink":"https://presnell.github.io/post/classroomr/","publishdate":"2020-08-08T10:49:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/classroomr/","section":"post","summary":"How to avoid reinstalling packages everytime you teach with R.","tags":[],"title":"Setting R's Library Path on UF Classroom PCs","type":"post"},{"authors":["Brett Presnell"],"categories":[],"content":" What Is This About?   This started as a list of errata that either I or my students had noticed in the exercises and the solutions manual for the 7th edition of Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer\u0026#39;s math stat text.\n This list was posted as a plain ASCII text file on my old web pages and since I took those pages down I have been surprised by the number of students and teachers who either wanted a copy of the list, or who had questions or comments about other exercises or solutions in the text. So I decided to repost them here as a public service. I hope that I have not introduced any errors in the process of converting them to org-mode. If you prefer the original text files you can grab them here (exercises) and here (solutions).\n NB: I last taught from this text in 2008, not because I have any problem with the text itself, but because in the intervening time I have not been assigned to teach my department\u0026#39;s undergrad math stat sequence. I have not checked whether any of these errata have been corrected in later printings.\n  Some Errata Found in the Exercises   This is just a list of a few errata that I happen to have noticed. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list.\nExercise 2.79   \u0026#34;\\(P(B) \u0026lt; 1\\)\u0026#34; should be \u0026#34;\\(P(B) \u0026gt; 0\\)\u0026#34;.\n  Exercise 2.80   Change \u0026#34;\\(P(B) \u0026gt; 0\\)\u0026#34; to \u0026#34;\\(P(B) \u0026lt; 1\\)\u0026#34;.  Since \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\), the assumption that \\(P(A) \u0026gt; 0\\) already implies that \\(P(B) \u0026gt; 0\\), so it is redundant to assume that \\(P(B) \u0026gt; 0\\). If, on the other hand, \\(P(B) = 1\\), then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are necessarily independent, and the objective of the exercise is to show that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be dependent except in the uninteresting case that one or the other of the events has probability zero or one.\n  Exercise 2.106   I would change this to ask \u0026#34;what is the smallest possible value for \\(P(A)\\)\u0026#34; or something similar. \u0026#34;What is \\(P(A)\\)?\u0026#34; gives the impression that one should be able to divine the exact value of \\(P(A)\\) from the information given, which isn\u0026#39;t true.\n  Exercise 3.38   This is the same as the triangular taste test example that I give in class, except that here it is not carefully worded. The statement\n Suppose that the two formulas are equally attractive.\n should be changed to\n Suppose that the two formulas are indistinguishable.\n  Why?\n If the two formulations are equally attractive on average but distinguishable, say by everyone, then on the average half of all tasters would choose the glass containing formula B. (The other half would choose one of the two glasses containing formula A.) So, if the two formulas are \u0026#34;equally attractive\u0026#34; but distinguishable by everyone, then the distribution of \\(Y\\) would be binomial on \\(n = 4\\) trials with success probability \\(p = 1/2\\).\n If the two formulas are \u0026#34;equally attractive\u0026#34; and can be distinguished by some but not all tasters, then we would need more information to do the problem.\n With the change I suggest above (\u0026#34;indistinguishable\u0026#34; rather than \u0026#34;equally attractive\u0026#34; formulas), each taster is effectively picking at random among the three glasses and \\(Y\\) is binomial on \\(n = 4\\) trials with success probability \\(p = 1/3\\). This is what was actually intended and is the solution given in the solutions manual.\n  Exercise 5.85   This exercise should probably be starred, since it refers to exercise 5.65, which is starred.\n  Exercise 5.94   The word \u0026#34;uncorrelated\u0026#34; should be deleted from this problem. Nothing in the problem changes if \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) are correlated.\n    Some Errata Found in the Solutions Manual  2.5 (b)   This is completely wrong. It should be something like\n \\begin{align} B \\cup (A \\cap \\bar B) \u0026amp;= (B \\cup A) \\cap (B \\cup \\bar B) \\\\ \u0026amp;= (B \\cup A) \\cap S \\\\ \u0026amp;= B \\cup A \\\\ \u0026amp;= A \\end{align}\n  2.42   Should be \\(P^{10}_3 = 10!/7! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 720\\).\n  2.44 (b)   Change \\(3\\) to \\(3!\\) and \\(45\\) to \\(90\\).\n Also, the solution to 2.44 (a) is correct but expressed in an odd way. It would be better as \\begin{equation} \\binom{8}{3} \\times \\binom{5}{5}. \\end{equation}\n  2.45   Change the 7 to a 5. Answer should be \\(\\binom{17}{2\\ \\ 5\\ \\ 10} = 408,408\\).\n  2.59 (b)   There are actually 10 different kinds of straights (starting with any of A, 2, 3, …, 10).\n  2.65   Should be \\(5!(2/6)(1/6)^4 = 5/162\\).\n  2.114   The answers are listed as parts a,b,b,d (two b\u0026#39;s and no c), and there are a couple of misprints in the answer to b. It should read\n \\begin{align} \u0026amp; \\text{a. } P(LL) = (.95)(.10) = 0.095 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{b. } P(LT) = (.95)(.9) = 0.855 \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{c. } P(TL) = (.05)(.10) = 0.005 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{d. } 1 ­ (.05)(.90) = 0.955 \\end{align}\n  3.48(a)   For \\(P(Y \\ge 1)\\), the solution should be\n \\begin{align} P(Y \\ge 1) \u0026amp;= 1 - P(Y = 0) \\\\ \u0026amp;= 1- \\binom{5}{0}(0.9)^0(0.1)^5 \\\\ \u0026amp;= 1 - (0.1)^5 \\\\ \u0026amp;= 0.99999 \\\\ \\end{align}\n  3.113   There is a 3 that should be changed to 1:\n \\begin{equation} \\frac{\\binom{8}{1}\\binom{12}{5}}{\\binom{20}{6}} + \\frac{\\binom{8}{0}\\binom{12}{6}}{\\binom{20}{6}} = 0.187. \\end{equation}\n  4.57   The density of \\(D\\) is wrong here. It is not equal to \\(1/4\\) on the interval \\((.01, .05)\\), but to \\(1/(.05 - .01) = 25\\). Also, the choice of \\(d\\) as the dummy variable of integration is unfortunate here, because it leads to\n \\begin{equation} \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\int_{.01}^{.05} 25\\, d^3 \\,dd \\end{equation}\n and the \\(dd\\) is confusing. Note that this is meant to be the same as\n \\begin{equation} \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\int_{.01}^{.05} 25\\, y^3 \\,dy. \\end{equation}\n Anyway, the numerical answer for the mean volume (\\(.0000065\\times\\pi\\)) is correct, but the answer for the variance of the volume is not (it should be \\(0.00000000003525\\,\\pi^2\\), i.e., \\((3.525397 \\times 10^{-11})\\,\\pi^2\\).\n  4.74 (d)   This part has been left unfinished. Having found that the lower quartile of test scores is \\(73.98\\), we are supposed to find what proportion of test takers score \\(73.98 + 5 = 78.98\\) or more. Using the normal table, the final answer is \\(.4364\\) (because of rounding, this is slightly different from the answer you would get if if you did the whole exercise using a computer, \\(.4369\\)).\n  4.92   In the calculation of \\(E(Y^3)\\) and \\(E(Y^4)\\), the 100\u0026#39;s in the integrals should be 10\u0026#39;s, and the results should be \\begin{equation} E(Y^3) = \\Gamma(4)\\times 10^4 = 3! \\times 10^4 = 6000 \\end{equation} and \\begin{equation*} E(Y^4) = Γ(5)× 10^5 = 4! × 10^5 = 240,000. \\end{equation*}\n  5.9 (b)   The integral is set up incorrectly, but the numerical answer \\(31/64\\) is correct.\n  6.14   Change \\(P(Y_1 \u0026gt; u/Y_2)\\) to \\(1 - P(Y_1 \u0026gt; u/Y_2)\\).\n    ","date":1592365057,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592365057,"objectID":"295226498aee7f1039f879302a04cfe6","permalink":"https://presnell.github.io/post/wackmendscheerrata/","publishdate":"2020-06-16T23:37:37-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/wackmendscheerrata/","section":"post","summary":"A partial list of errata and other comments.","tags":[],"title":"Mathematical Statistics With Applications (7th Edition) by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer","type":"post"},{"authors":["Brett Presnell"],"categories":[],"content":" What Is This About?

Alternatively, check out the ascii package for R.\n#+NAME: round-tbl #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var tbl=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; :var fmt=\u0026#34;%.1f\u0026#34; (mapcar (lambda (row) (mapcar (lambda (cell) (if (floatp cell) (format fmt cell) cell)) row)) tbl) #+end_src #+begin_src R :results replace :colnames yes :post round-tbl[:colnames yes](*this*) z \u0026lt;- dplyr::tribble(~i, ~x, 6, -pi, -4, exp(1), 1, 2) z #+end_src #+RESULTS: | i | x | |----+------| | 6 | -3.1 | | -4 | 2.7 | | 1 | 2 |   Note that I get a 2 in the last cell, not the 2.0 that I was hoping for.

The problem is that something in the emacs/orgmode/elisp processing is intercepting the 2.000 and deciding that it\u0026#39;s an integer. Evidently I either need to figure that out or, alternatively, rewrite the elisp code to operate on the table in a column wise manner (ignoring the column header).\n Note that it\u0026#39;s easy to change the format used, but of course it doesn\u0026#39;t do a thing about the \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.\n#+begin_src R :results replace :colnames yes :post round-tbl[:colnames yes](*this*, fmt=\u0026#34;%.3f\u0026#34;) z \u0026lt;- dplyr::tribble(~i, ~x, 6, -pi, -4, exp(1), 1, 2) z #+end_src #+RESULTS: | i | x | |----+--------| | 6 | -3.142 | | -4 | 2.718 | | 1 | 2 |    Replacing Table Headers   Sometimes I want to replace the variable names used as column header in R export with a custom, multi-row header.

I have tried to illustrate this below.\n For me the tables would normally be something that had been computed in R, but for simplicity I\u0026#39;m just reading the data straight from the org file.\n#+name: headed_table | a | b | c | |-------+-----+-------| | red | 148 | 77.08 | | white | 140 | 72.92 | | blue | 102 | 53.13 | #+name: headless_table | red | 148 | 77.08 | | white | 140 | 72.92 | | blue | 102 | 53.13 | #+name: replacement_header | | Number | Percentage | | | of | of | | Color | Flags | Flags |   Here\u0026#39;s the (simple) elisp code.\n#+name: replace-header #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var tab=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; new_header=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; (append new_header (cons \u0026#39;hline tab)) #+END_SRC   Here\u0026#39;s how to call it straight from elisp to work with an existing org table.\n#+call: replace-header(headed_table, replacement_header) #+RESULTS: | | Number | Percentage | | | of | of | | Color | Flags | Flags | |-------+--------+------------| | red | 148 | 77.08 | | white | 140 | 72.92 | | blue | 102 | 53.13 |   Here\u0026#39;s calling it from R with a table having a header.\n#+begin_src R :var data=headed_table :post replace-header(*this*, replacement_header) data #+end_src #+RESULTS: | | Number | Percentage | | | of | of | | Color | Flags | Flags | |-------+--------+------------| | red | 148 | 77.08 | | white | 140 | 72.92 | | blue | 102 | 53.13 |   Here\u0026#39;s calling it from R with a headless table (probably pretty rare in practice).\n#+begin_src R :var data=headless_table :colnames no :post replace-header(*this*, replacement_header) data #+end_src #+RESULTS: | | Number | Percentage | | | of | of | | Color | Flags | Flags | |-------+--------+------------| | red | 148 | 77.08 | | white | 140 | 72.92 | | blue | 102 | 53.13 |   And here is how to combine this with the formatting provided by the round-tbl function from elsewhere in this document: just compose the functions in the :post header argument.\n#+begin_src R :var data=headed_table :post replace-header(round-tbl(*this*, \u0026#34;%.1f\u0026#34;), replacement_header) data #+end_src #+RESULTS: | | Number | Percentage | | | of | of | | Color | Flags | Flags | |-------+--------+------------| | red | 148 | 77.1 | | white | 140 | 72.9 | | blue | 102 | 53.1 |    Naming Source Code Blocks and Their Results for Referencing   This response by Nicolas Goaziou is as clear an explanation as you\u0026#39;ll ever see.   :results drawer and maybe :wrap export org   These might be useful for code blocks that need to be evaluated as org text.
