Using the concepts and methods covered in this course, statistical problems which might otherwise be treated as a series of special cases can be reduced to their essentials, faciltating rigorous and often simpler proofs of more powerful results. Mastery of these concepts and methods is thus critical for advanced work in mathematical statistics.\nSyllabus Prerequisites  Basic real analysis/advanced calculus (at the level of MAA 5228, MAA 6236, or equivalent). A solid grasp of real analysis will be essential.\n Some knowledge of basic probability and mathematical statistics will be very helpful (at a minimum at the level of STA 4321-4322 or STA 5325-5328, and preferably at the level of STA 6326-6327.)\n  Please see the instructor if in doubt about the prerequisites.\nInstructor  Brett Presnell  Time \u0026amp; Location  M, W, F, Period 8 (3:00 PM - 3:50 PM) in FLO 0230  Canvas You can find the course website in Canvas by logging into UF\u0026rsquo;s elearning website using your gatorlink username and password. The course notes, assignments, and so forth can be found there.\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1566778886,"objectID":"3896955e58995fac147cddbae7cf1433","permalink":"https://presnell.github.io/teaching/sta7466/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/sta7466/","section":"teaching","summary":"The first course in a two-course sequence on measure theoretic probability.","tags":null,"title":"Overview","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Brett Presnell"],"categories":[],"content":" What Is This About?   The IT folks want to shut down our department\u0026#39;s Apache server, so I\u0026#39;m in the process of moving my web presence, such as it is, elsewhere, with elsewhere being github, at least for now. I probably won\u0026#39;t move much of the old stuff over, since it\u0026#39;s, well, old, but if there was something there that you found useful, send me an email and I\u0026#39;ll see what I can to to make it available again. Course Web Pages   Tonight I decided to hide the web pages for courses I\u0026#39;m teaching under the \u0026#34;Teaching\u0026#34; menu up above, so if you\u0026#39;re in my probability class, you know what to do.
