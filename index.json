Years ago, while teaching our undergraduate categorical data analysis course, I created a small R package consisting mainly of datasets from the text An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis (2nd edn) by my colleague Alan Agresti, along with a few convenience functions. My primary goal was to make it easy for my students to get started on the examples and exercises, so the help files for each dataset included fairly detailed R code and in my mind this is really the the main feature of the package.\n Unfortunately, I haven\u0026#39;t taught the course over a decade, so I have not been actively maintaining the package and by now there is a newer edition of the text and probably several other associated R packages. Nevertheless, I still occassionally get requests for the package and I put it on github a while back to make it more easily available. So, if you landed on my web pages while looking for the icda package, you can install it in R with the following sequence of commands:\ninstall.packages(\u0026#34;devtools\u0026#34;) library(devtools) install_github(\u0026#34;presnell/icda\u0026#34;)    ","date":1651675396,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651676627,"objectID":"685af4e16aa305fb438efbf33ae12cd2","permalink":"https://presnell.github.io/post/icda/","publishdate":"2022-05-04T10:43:16-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/icda/","section":"post","summary":"Functions and datasets to accompany Agresti, \"An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis (2nd edn)\".","tags":[],"title":"R Package icda","type":"post"},{"authors":["Brett Presnell"],"categories":[],"content":"  Once upon a time I did a little work on ranked set sampling with my former colleague Lora Bohn which was eventually published in the Journal of Nonparametric Statistics.

After a very long hiatus from needing to run R in the classrooms, I am back at it. The classroom (Windows 10) PCs at UF are refreshed every night and all local files created by users are wiped. By default, R packages installed by users are placed in C:/Program Files/R/R-3.5.2/library,1 and like everything else that users create, they are wiped every night. Thus, if you accept the default behavior, you have to resintall any packages you need every time you need them.2 This has been the source of some frustration for me and at least one of my colleagues, so I decided to do something about it. This post describes my current (partial) solution, which I think should also be useful for folks running R or RStudio on a desktop PC in their office (in my department at UF anyway). It\u0026#39;s nothing fancy, and if someone has a better solution I would be happy to hear about it.\n  My Solution   Download this file and save it under the name .Rprofile in your home directory on the departmental file server (so ~/.Rprofile in linux and H:/.Rprofile in Windows), or use a text editor to create the file yourself with with the following contents:\nif (grepl(\u0026#34;Windows\u0026#34;, Sys.info()[\u0026#34;sysname\u0026#34;])) { my.lib.path \u0026lt;- file.path(\u0026#34;H:\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;R\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;win-library\u0026#34;, paste(R.version$major, sub(\u0026#34;\\\\..*$\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, R.version$minor), sep=\u0026#34;.\u0026#34;)) if (!dir.exists(my.lib.path)) dir.create(my.lib.path, recursive = TRUE) .libPaths(my.lib.path) rm(my.lib.path) }   Now, whenever you start R in the classroom, run the command\nsource(\u0026#34;H:/.Rprofile\u0026#34;)   This first checks that you are running R in Windows. If so, then it checks for the existence of the directory H:/R/win-library/X.Y, where X is the major version number and Y is the minor version of the current R process, and it creates this directory if it doesn\u0026#39;t already exist. It then adds this directory to the front of R\u0026#39;s library path so that (1) R will look for packages there before trying the system packages, and (2) R will install any new packages into this directory rather than the system directory.\n If anything about that is not ok with you, then you will need to modify .Rprofile to suit your specific needs. If you already have a directory of installed R packages, you can either move/rename it to match this scheme, or you can modify the script to match, assuming that your directory is on your H: drive.\nIf You Run R in Windows in Your Office   If you place a copy of this .Rprofile file in whatever directory is returned by the R command path.expand(\u0026#39;~\u0026#39;) (probably C:/Users/\u0026lt;yourusername\u0026gt;/Documents), then R will run it automatically upon startup (on your office PC) and any libraries you install in your office will be saved to your H: drive. Also, as long as your office PC and the classroom PCs are running the same version of R, they will share the same set of user-installed R packages.\n    Further Background and Explanation   You can skip this if you like â€¦\n When I login to a classroom machine, my home directory from the departmental (virtual) file server is mounted as the H: drive in Windows. So, to sidestep the problem of repeatedly installing packages, I initially created the folder R/win-library/3.53 in my home directory on the file server, and in the classroom, I just ran the R command .libPaths(\u0026#34;H:/R/win-library/3.5\u0026#34;) immediately after starting R (or RStudio). With this, any libraries I install are saved on the departmental file server and they are found again the next time I teach (once I have run that command).\n Of course this is still pretty annoying and I wanted to arrange things so that it would be done automatically by an .Rprofile startup file. This works if the file is placed in C:/Users/myusername/Documents, which the R command path.expand(\u0026#39;~\u0026#39;) returns as be the default user home on our classroom Windows PCs, but of course that file would also get wiped every night, so placing the file there doesn\u0026#39;t help.\n Nevertheless, to accomodate differing/changing versions of R and to automate the process as much as possible, I decided to create a .Rprofile that checks if I am running Windows and if so, sets my R library path to .libPaths(\u0026#34;H:/R/win-library/X.Y\u0026#34;). The X.Y is replaced by whatever \u0026#34;major.minor\u0026#34; version of R is running (currently 3.5) and the directory is created if it doesn\u0026#39;t already exist. Because this is done only if I am running Windows, it has no effect on my usual, completely satisfactory R environment in Linux.\n The contents of my current .Rprofile file are given in the previous section. If you already have a non-empty .Rprofile, you could add this to it, and of course you could also create different versions for different classes and put them in the appropriate places if that tickles your fancy. In the classroom I still have to run\nsource(\u0026#34;H:/.Rprofile\u0026#34;)  after starting R, but I guess I\u0026#39;m going to have to live with that.\n  Footnotes   1Coming from the UNIX/Linux world this already seems a bit crazy. Why am I running R as root here? BTW, you should mentally replace \u0026#34;3.5.2\u0026#34; with whatever version of R is currently installed on the PC, and Windows/DOS users may be more comfortable replacing the \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; path separator by \u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;.\n 2The classroom IT folks suggest using a USB thumbdrive as a workaround. insert sad face here\n 3From what I saw on the classroom PCs, it appears that win-library is the R default name for the user\u0026#39;s R libraries in Windows, so I decided to stick with that. (On Linux it\u0026#39;s something like x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library.)\n    ","date":1596898140,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596898140,"objectID":"e67b226da41d629aa34e9276488ec470","permalink":"https://presnell.github.io/post/classroomr/","publishdate":"2020-08-08T10:49:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/classroomr/","section":"post","summary":"How to avoid reinstalling packages everytime you teach with R.","tags":[],"title":"Setting R's Library Path on UF Classroom PCs","type":"post"},{"authors":["Brett Presnell"],"categories":[],"content":" What Is This About?   This started as a list of errata that either I or my students had noticed in the exercises and the solutions manual for the 7th edition of Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer\u0026#39;s math stat text.\n This list was posted as a plain ASCII text file on my old web pages and since I took those pages down I have been surprised by the number of students and teachers who either wanted a copy of the list, or who had questions or comments about other exercises or solutions in the text. So I decided to repost them here as a public service. I hope that I have not introduced any errors in the process of converting them to org-mode. If you prefer the original text files you can grab them here (exercises) and here (solutions).\n NB: I last taught from this text in 2008, not because I have any problem with the text itself, but because in the intervening time I have not been assigned to teach my department\u0026#39;s undergrad math stat sequence. I have not checked whether any of these errata have been corrected in later printings.\n  Some Errata Found in the Exercises   This is just a list of a few errata that I happen to have noticed. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list.\nExercise 2.79   \u0026#34;\\(P(B) \u0026lt; 1\\)\u0026#34; should be \u0026#34;\\(P(B) \u0026gt; 0\\)\u0026#34;.\n  Exercise 2.80   Change \u0026#34;\\(P(B) \u0026gt; 0\\)\u0026#34; to \u0026#34;\\(P(B) \u0026lt; 1\\)\u0026#34;.  Since \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\), the assumption that \\(P(A) \u0026gt; 0\\) already implies that \\(P(B) \u0026gt; 0\\), so it is redundant to assume that \\(P(B) \u0026gt; 0\\). If, on the other hand, \\(P(B) = 1\\), then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are necessarily independent, and the objective of the exercise is to show that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) must be dependent except in the uninteresting case that one or the other of the events has probability zero or one.\n  Exercise 2.106   I would change this to ask \u0026#34;what is the smallest possible value for \\(P(A)\\)\u0026#34; or something similar. \u0026#34;What is \\(P(A)\\)?\u0026#34; gives the impression that one should be able to divine the exact value of \\(P(A)\\) from the information given, which isn\u0026#39;t true.\n  Exercise 3.38   This is the same as the triangular taste test example that I give in class, except that here it is not carefully worded. The statement\n Suppose that the two formulas are equally attractive.\n should be changed to\n Suppose that the two formulas are indistinguishable.\n  Why?\n If the two formulations are equally attractive on average but distinguishable, say by everyone, then on the average half of all tasters would choose the glass containing formula B. (The other half would choose one of the two glasses containing formula A.) So, if the two formulas are \u0026#34;equally attractive\u0026#34; but distinguishable by everyone, then the distribution of \\(Y\\) would be binomial on \\(n = 4\\) trials with success probability \\(p = 1/2\\).\n If the two formulas are \u0026#34;equally attractive\u0026#34; and can be distinguished by some but not all tasters, then we would need more information to do the problem.\n With the change I suggest above (\u0026#34;indistinguishable\u0026#34; rather than \u0026#34;equally attractive\u0026#34; formulas), each taster is effectively picking at random among the three glasses and \\(Y\\) is binomial on \\(n = 4\\) trials with success probability \\(p = 1/3\\). This is what was actually intended and is the solution given in the solutions manual.\n  Exercise 5.85   This exercise should probably be starred, since it refers to exercise 5.65, which is starred.\n  Exercise 5.94   The word \u0026#34;uncorrelated\u0026#34; should be deleted from this problem. Nothing in the problem changes if \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) are correlated.\n    Some Errata Found in the Solutions Manual  2.5 (b)   This is completely wrong. It should be something like\n \\begin{align} B \\cup (A \\cap \\bar B) \u0026amp;= (B \\cup A) \\cap (B \\cup \\bar B) \\\\ \u0026amp;= (B \\cup A) \\cap S \\\\ \u0026amp;= B \\cup A \\\\ \u0026amp;= A \\end{align}\n  2.42   Should be \\(P^{10}_3 = 10!/7! = 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 = 720\\).\n  2.44 (b)   Change \\(3\\) to \\(3!\\) and \\(45\\) to \\(90\\).\n Also, the solution to 2.44 (a) is correct but expressed in an odd way. It would be better as \\begin{equation} \\binom{8}{3} \\times \\binom{5}{5}. \\end{equation}\n  2.45   Change the 7 to a 5. Answer should be \\(\\binom{17}{2\\ \\ 5\\ \\ 10} = 408,408\\).\n  2.59 (b)   There are actually 10 different kinds of straights (starting with any of A, 2, 3, â€¦, 10).\n  2.65   Should be \\(5!(2/6)(1/6)^4 = 5/162\\).\n  2.114   The answers are listed as parts a,b,b,d (two b\u0026#39;s and no c), and there are a couple of misprints in the answer to b. It should read\n \\begin{align} \u0026amp; \\text{a. } P(LL) = (.95)(.10) = 0.095 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{b. } P(LT) = (.95)(.9) = 0.855 \\\\ \u0026amp; \\text{c. } P(TL) = (.05)(.10) = 0.005 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{d. } 1 Â­ (.05)(.90) = 0.955 \\end{align}\n  3.48(a)   For \\(P(Y\u0026gt;=1)\\), the solution should be\n \\begin{align} P(Y \u0026gt;= 1) \u0026amp;= 1 - P(Y = 0) \\\\ \u0026amp;= 1- \\binom{5}{0}(0.9)^0(0.1)^5 \\\\ \u0026amp;= 1 - (0.1)^5 \\\\ \u0026amp;= 0.99999 \\\\ \\end{align}\n  3.113   There is a 3 that should be changed to 1:\n \\begin{equation} \\frac{\\binom{8}{1}\\binom{12}{5}}{\\binom{20}{6}} + \\frac{\\binom{8}{0}\\binom{12}{6}}{\\binom{20}{6}} = 0.187. \\end{equation}\n  4.57   The density of \\(D\\) is wrong here. It is not equal to \\(1/4\\) on the interval \\((.01, .05)\\), but to \\(1/(.05 - .01) = 25\\). Also, the choice of \\(d\\) as the dummy variable of integration is unfortunate here, because it leads to\n \\begin{equation} \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\int_{.01}^{.05} 25\\, d^3 \\,dd \\end{equation}\n and the \\(dd\\) is confusing. Note that this is meant to be the same as\n \\begin{equation} \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\int_{.01}^{.05} 25\\, y^3 \\,dy. \\end{equation}\n Anyway, the numerical answer for the mean volume (\\(.0000065\\times\\pi\\)) is correct, but the answer for the variance of the volume is not (it should be \\(0.00000000003525\\,\\pi^2\\), i.e., \\((3.525397 \\times 10^{-11})\\,\\pi^2\\).\n  4.74 (d)   This part has been left unfinished. Having found that the lower quartile of test scores is \\(73.98\\), we are supposed to find what proportion of test takers score \\(73.98 + 5 = 78.98\\) or more. Using the normal table, the final answer is \\(.4364\\) (because of rounding, this is slightly different from the answer you would get if if you did the whole exercise using a computer, \\(.4369\\)).\n  4.92   In the calculation of \\(E(Y^3)\\) and \\(E(Y^4)\\), the 100\u0026#39;s in the integrals should be 10\u0026#39;s, and the results should be \\begin{equation} E(Y^3) = \\Gamma(4)\\times 10^4 = 3! \\times 10^4 = 6000 \\end{equation} and \\begin{equation*} E(Y^4) = Î“(5)Ã— 10^5 = 4! Ã— 10^5 = 240,000. \\end{equation*}\n  5.9 (b)   The integral is set up incorrectly, but the numerical answer \\(31/64\\) is correct.\n  6.14   Change \\(P(Y_1 \u0026gt; u/Y_2)\\) to \\(1 - P(Y_1 \u0026gt; u/Y_2)\\).\n    ","date":1592365057,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592365057,"objectID":"295226498aee7f1039f879302a04cfe6","permalink":"https://presnell.github.io/post/wackmendscheerrata/","publishdate":"2020-06-16T23:37:37-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/wackmendscheerrata/","section":"post","summary":"A partial list of errata and other comments.","tags":[],"title":"Mathematical Statistics With Applications (7th Edition) by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer","type":"post"},{"authors":["Brett Presnell"],"categories":[],"content":" What Is This About?

Occassionally there are source blocks (like \u0026#34;code chunks\u0026#34; if you\u0026#39;re coming from the Rmarkdown world) that can take a while to execute. Such computations can be cached if you set the :cache header to yes (see the org manual for more on this). However, the :cache header is ignored when exporting the document (there are good reasons for this), and there are other times when you may want to bypass this mechanism for more manual control. Another way to handle this is to save the results from R (e.g., using saveRDS()) and then either recompute them or read them back into R (e.g., readRDS()), as desired, and this can be done in a more-or-less automatic fashion by setting the :eval header argument on the relevant source blocks conditionally.\n It is especially convenient to have emacs query you for whether or not you want to recompute the results (versus reading in saved results). This can be accomplished by inserting the following near the top of the org file (before any of the relevant source blocks):\n#+begin_src emacs-lisp (setq use-saved-results (y-or-n-p \u0026#34;Use saved results?\u0026#34;)) #+end_src   Then for source blocks that should only be computed when you respond \u0026#34;n\u0026#34;, set the :eval header argument as follows:\n#+header :eval (if use-saved-results \u0026#34;no\u0026#34; \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;)  and for source blocks that should only be computed when you respond \u0026#34;y\u0026#34;:\n#+header :eval (if use-saved-results \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34; \u0026#34;no\u0026#34;)    Formatting Numerical Table Entries   It can be rather painful to properly format numerical tables from R for export via org mode. Here is a slightly modified version of an example from the org mode manual that leaves integers untouched but prints floating point numbers with a specified format (almost).\n#+NAME: round-tbl #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var tbl=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; :var fmt=\u0026#34;%.1f\u0026#34; (mapcar (lambda (row) (mapcar (lambda (cell) (if (floatp cell) (format fmt cell) cell)) row)) tbl) #+end_src #+begin_src R :results replace :colnames yes :post round-tbl[:colnames yes](*this*) z \u0026lt;- dplyr::tribble(~i, ~x, 6, -pi, -4, exp(1), 1, 2) z #+end_src #+RESULTS: | i | x | |----+------| | 6 | -3.1 | | -4 | 2.7 | | 1 | 2 |   Note that I get a 2 in the last cell, not the 2.0 that I was hoping for. FWIW, wrapping z in print.data.frame() in the R code does not solve this problem. The problem is that something in the emacs/orgmode/elisp processing is intercepting the 2.000 and deciding that it\u0026#39;s an integer. Evidently I either need to figure that out or, alternatively, rewrite the elisp code to operate on the table in a column wise manner (ignoring the column header).\n Note that it\u0026#39;s easy to change the format used, but of course it doesn\u0026#39;t do a thing about the \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;.\n#+begin_src R :results replace :colnames yes :post round-tbl[:colnames yes](*this*, fmt=\u0026#34;%.3f\u0026#34;) z \u0026lt;- dplyr::tribble(~i, ~x, 6, -pi, -4, exp(1), 1, 2) z #+end_src #+RESULTS: | i | x | |----+--------| | 6 | -3.142 | | -4 | 2.718 | | 1 | 2 |    Replacing Table Headers   Sometimes I want to replace the variable names used as column header in R export with a custom, multi-row header. Here\u0026#39;s an example of how this might be done. I haven\u0026#39;t been careful about handling headers in the elisp code, so one may need to be careful about setting :colnames (and possibly :hlines) appropriately (note that :colnames nil is the default (and :hlines no). I have tried to illustrate this below.\n For me the tables would normally be something that had been computed in R, but for simplicity I\u0026#39;m just reading the data straight from the org file.\n#+name: headed_table | a | b | c | |-------+-----+-------| | red | 148 | 77.08 | | white | 140 | 72.92 | | blue | 102 | 53.13 | #+name: headless_table | red | 148 | 77.08 | | white | 140 | 72.92 | | blue | 102 | 53.13 | #+name: replacement_header | | Number | Percentage | | | of | of | | Color | Flags | Flags |   Here\u0026#39;s the (simple) elisp code.\n#+name: replace-header #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var tab=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; new_header=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; (append new_header (cons \u0026#39;hline tab)) #+END_SRC   Here\u0026#39;s how to call it straight from elisp to work with an existing org table.\n#+call: replace-header(headed_table, replacement_header) #+RESULTS: | | Number | Percentage | | | of | of | | Color | Flags | Flags | |-------+--------+------------| | red | 148 | 77.08 | | white | 140 | 72.92 | | blue | 102 | 53.13 |   Here\u0026#39;s calling it from R with a table having a header.\n#+begin_src R :var data=headed_table :post replace-header(*this*, replacement_header) data #+end_src #+RESULTS: | | Number | Percentage | | | of | of | | Color | Flags | Flags | |-------+--------+------------| | red | 148 | 77.08 | | white | 140 | 72.92 | | blue | 102 | 53.13 |   Here\u0026#39;s calling it from R with a headless table (probably pretty rare in practice).\n#+begin_src R :var data=headless_table :colnames no :post replace-header(*this*, replacement_header) data #+end_src #+RESULTS: | | Number | Percentage | | | of | of | | Color | Flags | Flags | |-------+--------+------------| | red | 148 | 77.08 | | white | 140 | 72.92 | | blue | 102 | 53.13 |   And here is how to combine this with the formatting provided by the round-tbl function from elsewhere in this document: just compose the functions in the :post header argument.\n#+begin_src R :var data=headed_table :post replace-header(round-tbl(*this*, \u0026#34;%.1f\u0026#34;), replacement_header) data #+end_src #+RESULTS: | | Number | Percentage | | | of | of | | Color | Flags | Flags | |-------+--------+------------| | red | 148 | 77.1 | | white | 140 | 72.9 | | blue | 102 | 53.1 |    Naming Source Code Blocks and Their Results for Referencing   This response by Nicolas Goaziou is as clear an explanation as you\u0026#39;ll ever see.   :results drawer and maybe :wrap export org   These might be useful for code blocks that need to be evaluated as org text.
